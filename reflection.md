- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    Encapsulation is interesting and is a little complex, but it is cool that it allows other classes to get and set the values of variables, but also protects the variables in certain classes from being modified. I feel like that is a big challenge sometimes when a particular section of code somehow alters the other, so it is nice to use encapsulation to avoid this.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    It was difficult to the passenger manifest to print correctly with the appropriate cars, but eventually I was able to have multiple passengers in a car and see this in the printed manifest. I would advise future students to build the train as instructed from engine up to train, because it is important to have the engine and car classes set up before anything else.
